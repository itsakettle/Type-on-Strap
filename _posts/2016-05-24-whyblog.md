My motivation to blog is to learn. I often do a lot of self driven learning but perhaps it doesn't stick as much as I would like. I hope that by writing blogs I will have a resource to look back through in the future. Others reading the content is a bonus but also a good motivation for keeping the quality high! 

I also blog about Obsessive Compulsive Disorder over on [foffocd.com](http://foffocd.com). I suffer from OCD and again the goal there is to document my experiences of it - this time in a pseudo analytical way i.e. there are a lot of diagrams. I do this to better understand the condition from which I suffer and so that in the future if needs be I can look back and might find something helpful. If others read it, then again that's a bonus.
