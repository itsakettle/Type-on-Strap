To improve road safety all cars in Ireland of a certain age must pass the [National Car Test (NCT)](https://www.ncts.ie). Failure rates by make and model of car in 2016 were recently published so I thought I'd have a quick poke around.

## Get the Data

You can get the data [here](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/2016-make-model-year-failures-at-nct). 

There's a lot of variables here so to simplifies things I just looked at:

VehicleMake - The make of the car.
YearOfBirth - The year the car was manufactured.
Total - The total number of cars.
PASS - The number of cars that passed the NCT.
 

{% highlight r %}
dt <- fread('data/Make Model Data 2016.csv', skip=4)
# We could remove all the columns but more readable to just select them
columns_to_select <- c('VehicleMake', 'YearOfBirth', 'Total', 'PASS')
dt <- dt[, columns_to_select, with=FALSE]
# Make the names nicer
nicer_column_names <- c('vehicle_make', 'year_of_birth', 'total', 'pass')
setnames(dt, columns_to_select, nicer_column_names)
print(dt)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}

## Top 5

To really simplify things let's just look at the top 5 car manufacturers and put the rest into a category called `other`.


{% highlight r %}
# Get the top 5 vehicle makes
dt_top_five_vehicle_makes <- dt[, .(total=sum(total)), 
                                  by=.(vehicle_make)][order(-total),][1:5, ]

print(dt_top_five_vehicle_makes)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##    vehicle_make  total
## 1:       TOYOTA 228651
## 2:   VOLKSWAGEN 182727
## 3:         FORD 169493
## 4:       NISSAN 108539
## 5:         OPEL  87685
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight r %}
# Select the top five makes
dt[!(vehicle_make %in% dt_top_five_vehicle_makes[, vehicle_make]), vehicle_make := 'other']
{% endhighlight %}

## Pass rates

Here's a plot of pass rate by `year_of_birth`. The size of the dots is the number of cars that were tested in 2016.


{% highlight r %}
dt_pass_rate_by_year <- dt[, .(total=sum(total),
                             pass=sum(pass),
                             pass_rate=sum(pass)/sum(total)), by=.(year_of_birth)]

ggplot(dt_pass_rate_by_year, aes(x=year_of_birth, y=pass_rate)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(aes(size=total)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(from=1900, to=2020, by=10)) +
  ggtitle('NCT pass rate', 'Top 5 manufacturers in 2016') +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor=element_blank()) +
  annotate('rect', xmin=2000, xmax=2012, ymin=0, ymax=1, 
           fill='steelblue', alpha=0.2)
{% endhighlight %}

There aren't that many cars prior to the year 2000 so let's remove these. Also, since vehicles made in the past 4 years do not need to be tested let's remove `year_of_birth` from 2013 to 2016. 


{% highlight r %}
dt_pass_rate_by_year <- dt[year_of_birth >= 2000 & year_of_birth <= 2012, 
                           .(total=sum(total),
                             pass=sum(pass),
                             pass_rate=sum(pass)/sum(total)), by=.(year_of_birth)]

ggplot(dt_pass_rate_by_year, aes(x=year_of_birth, y=pass_rate)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(aes(size=total)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=2000:2012) +
  ggtitle('NCT pass rate in 2016 by vehicle year of birth') +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor=element_blank()) 
{% endhighlight %}

                             pass=sum(pass),
                             pass_rate=sum(pass)/sum(total)), by=.(year_of_birth, vehicle_make)]
